# virtualhoodie
a repository of self-care resources

one day i wasn't feeling well and told some friends on slack that i was going to hide in my virtual hoodie. it started me thinking about how important the hoodie is, both as a defacto uniform for developers and as a utility item that provides comfort and warmth.

self-care is important and so often i see my fellow developers ignoring their basic needs for rest and refreshment. i started this site to provide a central location to find links that will help us all take better care of ourselves.
